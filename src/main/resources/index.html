<h4>About Me</h4>
Hello! I am Danny Piper (they/them) and, I am a student at Royal Holloway studying an embedded master in Computer Science
(Information Security). I am currently in my second year and enjoying it.<br>
I am an avid programmer and mainly program in Python, Java and, C. In-fact, this website is built with Java and Jetty,
Although I do prefer C for programming these days.<br>

<div id="foss-cont" class="hidden">
    I am passionate Arch Linux user and FOSS fan. Here are some of the projects I have made and contributed to.
    <h5>Maze Programs</h5>
    <h6>Maze Generators</h6>
    <a href="https://github.com/djpiper28/Maze-Generator">Java Maze
        Generator</a> - my first attempt at generating mazes, this was quite bad but fun to make.<br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/djpiper28/ANSI-C-Maze-Generator">ANSI C Maze
        Generator</a> - my latest and greatest maze generator. This one is really fast and makes large mazes quickly.
    <h6>Maze Solver</h6>
    <a href="https://github.com/djpiper28/MazeSolver-javafx">Java Maze
        Solver</a> - my first, decent attempt at solving mazes. It has a few cool methods to do so and works fairly well.
    <br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/djpiper28/OpenCLTest">OpenCL Maze
        Solver</a> - this is my first opencl program and is a fairly fussy but fast maze solver. Some input really upsets it though.
    <h5>MTG Tournament Programs</h5>
    I have been contributing in the MTG community lately to produce better
    software for running tournaments (see <a href="https://gitlab.com/monarch3">monarch3's</a> gitlab page
    and <a href="https://github.com/djpiper28/CockatriceTournamentBot">my cockatrice
        bot's</a> (I call this tricebot) github page to
    see some of these softwares). I have been working with monarch3 for a while now (since around late February 2021)
    and have been  actively working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/monarch3/SquireBot">Squire Bot</a>, which
    just so happens to live on this server along with tricebot.<br/>

<h4>Self Hosting</h4>
Lately I have been getting into system administration and hosting; to help me with this I brought a second hand
server off of eBay (a Dell PowerEdge R520 with 32 GiB for those who are interested). Unfortunately for me I have
to sleep in the same room as my server. But it is worth it because it means that I can continue learning about
hosting and system administration.<br>
<h4>Other Hobbies</h4>
Apart from computers and linux, I am also a fan of miniatures (painting and building Warhammer 40k usually),
listening to power/industrial metal and drinking coffee.<br><br>
