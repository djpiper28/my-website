        The left&apos; biggest enemy at times is themselves. Hopefully this
        document can be used as inspiration to create a unified policy and stop
        the left from fighting the left. In times like these, it is quite
        important that real, actual change occurs before it is too late. I think
        that wokisism and semantics are things that can be put aside until the
        real issues are solved: the rise of authoritarianism, deepening wealth
        inequality, and the concentration of power to oligarchs.
      </P>
      <P>
        Lately the rise of real, &quot;full-fat&quot; fascists has started: Elon
        Musk with his signature Nazi salute, Donald Trump with his foul regime,
        proscription of palestine action, the Israeli state&spos;s genocide in
        Gaza, etc... And at times it seems that the little man is powerless,
        that we are stuck living in a world that is doomed to become more vile
        by the day.
      </P>

        However, with a bit of luck, the use of the democratic process, and
        peaceful action perhaps something can be done to change the status quo.
        But that cannot be done until the left agree on what they want.

        This is the most important issue, as it affects everyone, and is a good
        right wing talking point. The Government has, over successive terms,
        been repealing civil liberties. The rights to peaceful protest have come
        under attack - the proscription of Palestine Action is unacceptable.
        They are a set of protesters who have sprayed some planes red, and
        damaged some weapons factories. They are not terrorists they are
        criminals.
