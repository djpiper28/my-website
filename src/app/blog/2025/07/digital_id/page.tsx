        has been decrying for a while now. The basic premise is for all adults
        to carry on their smartphones a form of digital ID, that can be used for
        checking right to work and live in the UK -{" "}

        &quot;Reports have suggested the government plans to use a new scheme to
        check people&apos;s right to live and work in the UK, with people&apos;s
        individual ID checked against a central database.&quot;

      <H2>Mass Surveillance</H2>
      <P>
        Digital ID will be a super app that does everything according to Sir
        Tony &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction In Iraq&quot; Blair, which sounds
        quite similar to WeChat which is China&apos;s state adjacent censorship
        and surveillance app. The think tank openly says &quot;If we used the
        potential of facial recognition, data and DNA, we would cut crime rates
        by not small but game-changing margins&quot;, because of this it is
        clear that the application will be used to harvest user data an
        industrial scale, this also implies the intent to track users, and
        associate them with other databases.
      </P>
      <P>
        As far as mass surveillance goes, this is the crown jewel. A central ID
        system that is used everywhere will allow the government to track any
        citizen as they make any interaction with the state. It is likely that
        it will become the prefered method of ID for bars, nightclubs, rental,
        etc... The state will have unfettered access to every facet of your
        life. Who you rent with, who you work for, your medical data (see{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1712">
          Palantir&apos;s NHS contract
        </Link>{" "}
        which is mostly redacted), which services you use, when, where, and how.
      </P>
      <P>
        It is true that the state already has access to a lot of data about
        citizens, however it is fragmented, stored in terrible systems made by
        consultants and cannot easily be searched. Centralising the data will
        provide a way for the state to peer into any and everything at will.
        Given that every passport holder already has had their face scanned, and
        the{" "}
        <Link href="https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2023/10/29/police-use-of-facial-recognition-factsheet/">
          police already have capability to use facial recognition
        </Link>
        , it is not unlikely that one day the police will use Digital ID facial
        recognition to help scan for more targets to arrest.
      </P>
      <P>
        Lastly, installing an app from the government that openly says it wants
        to spy on people is likely a terrible idea - the app may have lots of
        nasty features that the user cannot see, it might take location data,
        contact data, phone call data, read text messages, see what is installed
        on your phone, read network traffic, etc... Israeli spyware is invisible
        on phones and does all of this, the UK Government borrowing this tech to
        let its police gang stalk journalists and anyone else they don&apos;t
        like is a possibility, and when the app is compulsory it is makes it
        harder to stay safe.
      </P>
      <H2>Data Breaches</H2>
      <P>
        Any central database is the go to target for a state actor. If Digital
        IDs database was ever targeted then all of the services that rely on
        it will be affected causing billions of economic damage. Given the UK
        Government&apos;s track record of keeping data unsecure (see{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79qyl907lxo">
          Afghan data breach 1
        </Link>{" "}
        and{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce87nyr3evro">
          Afghan data breach 2
        </Link>
        ) it is not unlikely that more sensitive data will be stolen.
      </P>
      <P>
        On the plus side, it may be that Digital ID can be used to verify your
        age on websites (to appease The Online Safety Act) which would help to
        keep your data more secure by not sending data to American companies
        with rather lacklustre privacy policies. Although you may not want to
        do use a Digital ID to watch pornographic material as it will let the
        government know you like to watch filth.
      </P>
      <H2>Accessibility</H2>
      <P>
        As is the normal these days, being blind, deaf, homeless, having
        learning disabilities, or having issues using computers/phones is not
        something that the state cares about. It is very likely to leave people
        who cannot use technology as well as others behind.
      </P>
      <P>
        There is currently a claim that there will be an alternative for people
        who cannot access digital services, how that would work is a mystery to
        me.
      </P>
      <P>
        The state is obliged to consider disabled people with this policy due to
        The UK Equality Act 2010, although making a good solution for these
        people will involve them being involved in the consultation process
        before the bill is taken to Parliament.
      </P>
      <H2>The Petition</H2>
      <P>
        I, like 774,330 others at the time of writing, oppose the concept of
        Digital ID as I see it as state overreach, that will lead to more mass
        surveillance. I am also deeply concerned about it blocking people access
        to public services, and find the idea of it being mandatory worrying. If
        you agree then you can sign the{" "}

        on The Parliament petitions website.
      </P>
      <P>
        I will also add that Tony Blair wants to get his blood ridden fingers
        involved in{" "}

        becoming far more toxic, and divided.
