      <H1>Moving Away From LinkedIn</H1>
      <H2>It Feels Like Facebook</H2>
      <P>
        LinkedIn is full of virtue signaling, low quality posts, and
        connection requests from what feels like bots. Similar to Facebook the
        platform feels setup to facilitate spam arriving in your inbox. Most
        content on the platform is either as simple as a Google search AI
        result, or just irrelevant stuff about &quot;digital nomads&quot;, or
        some other trend that should be relegated to TikTok. Then you get the
        spam connection requests, either by recruiters who have no intention to
        recruit you, or by someone trying to sell you another course. The
        website does not feel like it is for professionals to talk about their
        profession, instead it feels like a corporate circle jerk of
        nothingness.

      <H2>Surface Level Posts</H2>
      <P>
        Another irritating part of LinkedIn is how everything feels so surface
        level. You will find a lot of &quot;We migrated database at our
        startup&quot; type posts, which often fail to discuss anything of value.
        No cost based evaluations, no technical reasons, no graphs, etc... Often
        times these posts read more like a Stack Overflow page, not a technical
        blog.
      </P>
      <H2>Mental Health</H2>
      <P>
        It is not just LinkedIn that I find problematic, most social media
        suffer from similar issues. I always find these sites make it easy to
        &quot;doom scroll&quot;, which for me always leads to many issues. I
        think that issues with social media affects a lot of people, and cutting
        them out is what worked for me.
      </P>
      <H2>What Does This Mean For You?</H2>
      <P>
        Pretty much nothing. If you are a recruiter, use my email. Otherwise it
        doesn&apos;t mean anything.
      </P>
